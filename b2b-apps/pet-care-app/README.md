# Pet Care Veterinary Practise Management Application User Guide

The Pet Care Veterinary Practise Management Application is a B2B (Business-to-Business) application designed to streamline and optimize the management and operations of veterinary practices. This comprehensive application caters specifically to the needs of veterinary clinics, hospitals, and other related healthcare facilities, providing a centralized platform to efficiently manage appointments, patient records, and other essential aspects of veterinary practice. Vet hospitals and other vet clinics can become part of the Pet Care application and access its services by joining the platform.

## Overview

The Pet Care application involves three primary stakeholders: the System Admin, Doctor, and Pet Owner. Below are the tasks performed by each stakeholder:

1. System Admin

    - Enroll and oversee the management of Doctors within the system.
    - Configure users, groups, roles, and Identity providers in the system.

2. Doctor

    - Modify and update their own profile information.
    - Set available time slots for appointment bookings.
    - Manage daily appointment bookings.
    - Provide medical reports for pets.

3. Pet Owner

    - Register and add pets to the system.
    - Manage vaccination dates and set up alerts for upcoming vaccinations.
    - Schedule doctor appointments for the pets.

### Business Onboarding

City Vet Hospital, a local veterinary hospital, currently offers medical consultations and various treatments for pets. The owner of City Vet Hospital aims to optimize their operations and reaches out to the Pet Care app through the available support channels. The Pet Care provider responds by adding the owner of City Vet Hospital as a System Admin within the Pet Care system. Consequently, the owner receives an email containing instructions on how to utilize the system. With this access, the owner can perform the tasks mentioned earlier and introduce the system to both their hospital staff and customers.

&nbsp;<br>
### B2B Access Management - Login Options

The System Admin of each of the Business can select a suitable login option for their user base. 

- Elite Vet is a local clinic where the doctor running the clinic also serves as the System Admin in the system. Due to their smaller user base, they have chosen to utilize a login method that involves username and password.

- Goodwill Vet Clinic, another local clinic similar to Elite Vet, places a higher emphasis on security. Consequently, they have opted for a login approach that includes both username and password along with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

- City Vet Hospital, a well-established hospital in the area, already has an Enterprise Identity Provider (IDP) that manages their hospital user accounts. In their case, they prefer integrating their existing Enterprise IDP with the Pet Care application, allowing for a seamless login experience.

## Solution

The solution is based on [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/), [Choreo](https://wso2.com/choreo/) and [Asgardeo](https://wso2.com/asgardeo/). 

- [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/) is an open-source language for cloud-native app development. It simplifies building microservices-based applications with modern syntax, built-in network support, service discovery, distributed transactions, and security features.

- [Choreo](https://wso2.com/choreo/), a SaaS application development suite, streamlines integration creation and management in cloud-native environments. It empowers developers with tools to connect, orchestrate, and secure applications and services, expediting digital experience development.

- [Asgardeo](https://wso2.com/asgardeo/), a Customer IAM (CIAM) solution by WSO2, offers extensive features for managing user identities, access privileges, and security in digital ecosystems. It caters to both B2C and B2B applications.

In this solution, there are three services written in Ballerina: the email service, channel service, and pet management service. The pet management service and channel service connect with the email service to send emails to users. These services are deployed in Choreo and exposed as APIs for consumption by applications. The email service functions internally. The Pet management web application, written in React JS, is hosted in Choreo using its hosting capabilities. Asgardeo authenticates users and utilizes its CIAM capabilities to enhance the customer experience. Asgardeo's B2B features are employed to develop this B2B application.

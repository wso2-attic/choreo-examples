# Pet Management Application User Guide

The Pet Management Application is a B2C (Business-to-Consumer) application that allows users to easily register and manage their pets. Users can enter vital information such as their pets' basic information and vaccination records into the app. They can then set up email alerts for their pets' upcoming vaccination dates. This guide will show you how to use [Choreo](https://wso2.com/choreo/) to expose a service endpoint as a REST API and safely consume the API from a web application. To secure user authentication to the web application and add CIAM features to your web application, you will use [Asgardeo](https://wso2.com/asgardeo/), WSO2's SaaS Customer IAM (CIAM) solution.

This guide walks you through the following steps:

1. Develop, deploy, and test a service component.
2. Publish the service endpoint as a REST API for your web application to consume.
3. Expose the REST API via Choreo API management.
4. Securely consume the published REST API via your web application.
5. Deploy your web application and enhance the customer experience with Asgardeo's CIAM features. 
---

# Step 1: Create and publish a Service

In this step, you will play the role of the API developer. You will create and publish the Service that the web application needs to consume. Before you proceed, sign in to [**Choreo Console**](https://console.choreo.dev/).

## Step 1.1: Create the Service

Let's create your first Service.
1. On the **Home** page, click on the project you created.
2. To add a new component, select **Components** from the left-side menu and click **Create**.
3. Click **Create** in the **Service** card.
4. Enter a unique name and a description for the Service. For example, you can enter the name and the description given below:

    | Field | Value |
    | -------- | -------- |
    | Name | Pet Management Service |
    | Description | Manage your pets |

5. Click **Next**.
6. To allow Choreo to connect to your GitHub account, click **Authorize with GitHub**.
7. If you have not already connected your GitHub repository to Choreo, enter your GitHub credentials, and select the repository you created by forking https://github.com/wso2/choreo-examples to install the Choreo GitHub App.
8. In the Connect Repository dialog box, enter the following information:

    | Field | Value |
    | -------- | -------- |
    | GitHub Account | Your account |
    | GitHub Repository | choreo-examples |
    | Branch | main |
    | Build Preset | Click **Ballerina** because you are creating the REST API from a Ballerina project and Choreo needs to run a Ballerina build to build it. |
    | Path | /b2c-apps/pet-care-app/pet-management-service |

9. Click **Create** to initialize a Service with the implementation from your GitHub repository.

The Service opens on a separate page where you can see its overview.

## Step 1.2: Deploy the Service

For the Service to be invokable, you need to deploy it. To deploy the Service, follow the steps given below:
1. Navigate to the **Choreo Console**. You will be viewing an overview of the Pet Management Service.
2. In the left pane, click **Deploy**, and then click **Configure & Deploy**.
3. In the **Configure & Deploy** pane, you will be asking to enter values for the **Defaultable Configurables**.
    - You can setup a **Mysql database** to store the service's data. This is **optional**, and if you do not specify database values, the service will save the data in memory. 

      <details><summary>If you are setting up <b>Mysql Database</b> click here</summary>
      <p>
      
      - Create a Mysql Database using the following database schema.
      
          ```sql
          CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS PET_DB;

          CREATE TABLE PET_DB.Pet (
              id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
              name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
              breed VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
              dateOfBirth VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
              owner VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
          );

          CREATE TABLE PET_DB.Vaccination (
              id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
              petId VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
              name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
              lastVaccinationDate VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
              nextVaccinationDate VARCHAR(255),
              enableAlerts BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
              FOREIGN KEY (petId) REFERENCES Pet(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
          );

          CREATE TABLE PET_DB.Thumbnail (
              id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
              fileName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
              content MEDIUMBLOB NOT NULL,
              petId VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
              FOREIGN KEY (petId) REFERENCES Pet(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
          );

          CREATE TABLE PET_DB.Settings (
              owner VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
              notifications_enabled BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
              notifications_emailAddress VARCHAR(255),
              PRIMARY KEY (owner)
          );
          ```
        
      - Make sure your database is publicly accessible and that your database service allows Choreo IP addresses. Please refer the guide [Connect with Protected Third Party Applications](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/reference/connect-with-protected-third-party-applications/#connect-with-protected-third-party-applications) for more information.

      - Configure the following **Defaultable Configurables** after setting up the database.   

        | Field      |  Value |
        | ---------- | -------- |
        | dbHost     | Database Host. eg: mysqlâ€“instance1.123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com  |
        | dbUsername | Database username |
        | dbPassword | Database password |
        | dbDatabase | Database name. eg: PET_DB  |
        | dbPort     | Database port. eg: 3306|

      </p>
      </details>

    &nbsp;<br>
    - The Pet Management Service sends email to the users. This is **optional**, and if you specify email configurations here, it will use to send emails to the users. 

      <details><summary>If you are setting up <b>email</b> click here</summary>
      <p>
            
      - In order to send emails to the users, you need to create a client for the SMTP server. Here is a guide for setting up a SMTP client for the **GMail**.
        - You can generate a password for the email username using [https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).
        - Configure the following **Defaultable Configurables** for the email configuration.   

          | Field      |  Value |
          | ---------- | -------- |
          | emailHost     | SMTP Host. eg: smtp.gmail.com  |
          | emailUsername | Email address |
          | emailPassword | Email password (The app password generated in the above.) |
      
      </p>
      </details>

    &nbsp;<br>
4. Click **Next** on the **Defaultable Configurables** to deploy the service.
5. Click **Deploy**.

## Step 1.3: Update runtime settings

If you are not connecting the service to a MySQL database and storing the service's data in memory, then you must follow the steps below to ensure that only one container is running for the service.

1. Navigate to the **DevOps** section in the component and click **Runtime**.
2. Make the Min replicas and Max replicas count to **1** and click **Update**.
3. Click **Redeploy Release** button.

## Step 1.4: Update API settings

1. Navigate to the **Manage** section in the component.

4. Toggle the **Pass Security Context To Backend** to pass the security context details to backend and click **Save**.
5. In the **Apply to Development** pane that opens on the right-hand side of the page, enter a meaningful message. Then click **Apply**.

## Step 1.5: Test the Service

Let's test the Pet Management Service via Choreo's Open API Console by following the steps given below:
1. Navigate to the **Test** section in the component and click **OpenAPI Console**. This will open up the Open API definition of the service.
2. Expand the **POST** method and click **Try it out**.

      "name": "Cooper",
      "vaccinations": [
        {
          "enableAlerts": true,
          "lastVaccinationDate": "03/01/2023",
          "name": "vaccine_1",
          "nextVaccinationDate": "07/17/2023"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

4. Click **Execute**.
5. Check the Server Response section. On successful invocation, you will receive the **201** HTTP code.
Similarly, you can expand and try out the other methods.

## Step 1.6: Publish the Service

Now that yourService is tested, let's publish it and make it available for applications to consume.

1. Navigate to the **Manage** section of the channel service and click **Lifecycle**.
2. Click **Publish** to publish the Service to the **Developer Portal**. External applications can subscribe to the API via the Developer Portal.
